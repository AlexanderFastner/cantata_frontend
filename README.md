## Use 
CANTATA is also a Community bAsed Non-bilaTeriAn Transcriptome Archive. The aim of this project is to provide an archive of non-bilaterian transcriptomic resources assembled and annotated in a standardized manner.
You can help further mantaining this archive by simply pushing text files with SRA read ftp addresses of the reads to be assembled (see below). 
The assembly and annotation will be done using computational resources of the Chair of Paläontology and Geobiology of the Dept. of Geo- and Environmental Sciences of the LMU München and made available to the community as a DOI minted CANTATA release.
